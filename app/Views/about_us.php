            <p class="mb-4">pH-Detector was founded with a singular vision: to provide the highest quality pH measurement solutions to industries and individuals who need accurate and reliable data. Established in [Year], our company was born out of the founders' passion for precision and their desire to address the gaps they observed in the pH detection market.</p>
            <p>The idea for pH-Detector emerged from Fernández Lucas and Schwartz Gaspar's extensive experience in the field of chemical analysis and instrumentation. They noticed that while many pH meters were available, few met the rigorous standards required for critical applications. Driven by a commitment to excellence and innovation, they set out to develop a range of pH detectors that combined advanced technology with ease of use.</p>
